# Downloader App
This is a Desktop Application built in Python Language which we can use to download various types of files whose links are available online. Only the thing to note is that while giving file-name, we need to specify it's extention with the file-name(Ex: abc.docx).

## Working
It builds a network connection as a client with the link server and thus uses the post request to get the data transfered by the byte stream using the TCP Protocol.
